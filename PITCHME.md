@title[UEFI Shell Elements]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >UEFI Shell Elements</span></p>

Note:

1)Small Size Profiles
Took the UEFI Shell that Intel has been working on as a starting point 4 areas for size

Levels of support
Different levels of support for different usage scenarios and space constraints:
Level 0: No Command-line Interface (CLI). No shell commands. Only shell API.
Level 1: Adds basic scripting support
Level 2: Adds basic commands (cd, cp, mv)
Level 3: Adds interactive CLI
Shell support level can be detected using an environment variable.
Beyond level 3, additional command “profiles” are defined for debug, networking and driver support

2) Shell Commands

Standardized existing usage
Updated for UEFI 2.1+
Standardized argument usage and output
Example some of the grep commands are standardized

3) New Shell API
Smaller executable size – put common functionally back into the shell
Expose previously hidden shell
  capabilities – the shell does some really cool things
– Example to change the current directory (CD) it did not exposes this and no one else could take advantage of this unless they were linked right into it

Execution break support – control “C”

4) Enhanced Scripting
Compatible with existing scripts
Added input redirection & piping
Enhanced if command
   example added capability to use shell without a HD or RAM Drive present. – may not have a HD for Manufacturing 
May not have a Hard drive input output to environment variables



UEFI Advantages = UEFI Shell Advantages
- Flat memory model
- Robust, extensible architecture
- File system, Network, Keyboard, Mouse

- UEFI Works = UEFI Shell Works
- No additional requirements to run

- Write Once/Run Anywhere For Pre-OS
- With standard API/commands = applications from different ISVs work on any platform (Ex: UEFI SCT)

@title[Small Size Profiles detail]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Small Size Profiles</span></p>


Note:
## Small Size Profiles

Different levels; defining a platform confined in a space – go with a smaller profile.  

Took the same shell commands that have always been there and standardized them

Some were never used so were deprecated 

Level 0: provide shell API and that is about it

Level 1: Provide basic scripting support – but not any command line interface so if you want any support then you need to provide the disk itself

Level 2: basic file manipulation commands

Level 3:CLI

Grouped the rest into 3 groups
- UEFI Debug
- Network
- Driver

@title[ShellPkg Main Libraries]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >ShellPkg Main Libraries</span></p>


Note:

There are three main libraries used by almost all shell commands 


- ShellLib 
  -  Used by both commands and applications. Provides easy access to Shell Protocols, File I/O, and printing to the user. 



- HandleParsingLib
   - Used by both commands and applications. Provides easy access for manipulating handles. This means things like 
conversion the handle to and from the handle index; the index is the 2 digit hex identifier of the handle seen by the user 
sorting of handles to determine parent controllers, child controllers, or which driver controls a given controller 

- ShellCommandLib 
  - fully usable only when linked within the shell binary and therefore only by internal shell commands. This provides extra features for internal commands.

<p align="center"><span class="gold" >Shell Scripts (Benefits)</span></p>

Note: 

The UEFI Shell can execute commands from a file, which is called a batch script file (.nsh files). 


### Benefits: These files allow users to simplify routine or repetitive tasks. 
- Perform basic flow control. 
- Allow branching and looping in a script. 
- Allow users to control input and output and call other batch programs (known as script nesting).

@title[Legacy vs. UEFI ]

### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Legacy vs. UEFI</span></p>

Note:
The UEFI SHELL is an UEFI application that allows you to interface with the UEFI environment prior to the time the OS is loaded. Once the OS starts loading, the UEFI environment is no longer accessible through the Shell. 
The UEFI Shell supports a command line interface similar to DOS or Unix.  In fact a lot of the same commands exist in the UEFI shell that are in DOS and forms of Linux.



---?image=/assets/images/slides/Slide54.JPG
@title[Shell Usage ]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Shell Usage</span></p>

Note:
The shell is where preboot programs  will execute.  For example, manufacturing test applications with the rich pre boot environment there is no need to run / execute an operating system
Typical environment that an EFI application might need to execute pre-operating system functions:

- Execute preboot programs
- update programs
- disk utilities
- tests(hwd and soft)
- operating system installation – Configuration utility of a Driver
- Diagnostics
- Platform Testing & Driver Diagnostics

- Move files around between different devices (hard disk, CD/DVD, USB flash drives, …)
- The shell is where files can be moved around just as in DOS or Unix.

- Load a preboot UEFI driver in the system (.efi)
- The shell is where preboot EFI drivers are loaded in the system such as a lan stack tcpip drivers, update old drivers in flash, new drivers for plugin cards etc.
 

- LAN stack & TCP/IP drivers
- Update old drivers in flash
- New drivers for plug-in cards

@title[Accessing the Shell]
### <p align="right"><span class="gold" >Accessing the Shell</span></p>

Note:
Boot UEFI Shell from FAT/FAT32 partition:
1.  Special boot file located under /EFI/boot/ directory:
    - BOOTia32.efi (IA32) or BOOTx64.efi (x64) or other NON IA

@title[UEFI File System & Device Path]

<p align="right"><span class="gold" >UEFI File System & Device Path</span></p>


Note:
Can manipulate only UEFI system partitions (FAT/FAT32) where boot loader and UEFI applications are located:

An example of the EFI File system is best seen using the MAP Command that will display the mappings in nvram between block devices .  
The EFI shell is replacing what is to the left of the “:” with the device path to the right of the “:”


- Blkxx designates a raw block device 
- Such as a disk controller, floppy controller etc.
- FSy designates that a block device has a fat file system on that device.
- The Map command displays all the raw block devices in the system and the FAT file systems mounted and usable.
- After the colon is the device path or physical location of where that device or file system is located.


- Lets try the Map Command on your classroom systems.

Note:
Can manipulate only UEFI system partitions (FAT/FAT32) where boot loader and UEFI applications are located:

An example of the EFI File system is best seen using the MAP Command that will display the mappings in nvram between block devices .  
The EFI shell is replacing what is to the left of the “:” with the device path to the right of the “:”


- Blkxx designates a raw block device 
- Such as a disk controller, floppy controller etc.
- FSy designates that a block device has a fat file system on that device.
- The Map command displays all the raw block devices in the system and the FAT file systems mounted and usable.
- After the colon is the device path or physical location of where that device or file system is located.


- Lets try the Map Command on your classroom systems.
